Potential Issues or Improvements:

Data Cleaning:

Issue: Columns are removed without considering their potential usefulness.
Improvement: Review the relevance of each column before removal. Some columns might contain valuable information.
Pie Charts for Distribution:

Issue: Pie charts may not be the best choice for visualizing the distribution of a large number of categories.
Improvement: Consider using bar charts for better clarity, especially when dealing with numerous categories.
Join Date Analysis:

Issue: The criteria for identifying potentially fake accounts might be arbitrary.
Improvement: Consider a more sophisticated approach, possibly involving statistical methods to identify anomalies.
Source Filtering:

Issue: Filtering for specific sources might exclude relevant data.
Improvement: Analyze the impact of excluding certain sources and consider a more inclusive approach.
Data Integrity:

Issue: Data might contain missing values or inconsistencies.
Improvement: Perform thorough data cleaning, handle missing values appropriately, and ensure data integrity.
Visualization Labels:

Issue: Some visualizations lack proper labels or legends.
Improvement: Add labels, legends, and titles to improve the interpretability of visualizations.
Date-wise Count Analysis:

Issue: Bar graph with dates may be cluttered for a large dataset.
Improvement: Consider aggregating data by day or week for a clearer visualization.
